Topic: The Art of Self-Study: Tips from a Lifelong Learner

-need systems and need to stay sharp
-follow-through is one of the hardest things to do in this age of information

Systems/organization:
-cycles: break down your goals into time periods, each period has a goal within it, and then concentrate on the smallest units (days, hours, minutes)
-use physical calendars (the act of writing it down commits it to memory), use apps to set reminders, scratch pad to write down ideas

Calendars:
-same time every week
-look over the next week
-use symbolism for different tasks
-be specific (workout ---> yoga and time alloted for it)
-highlight accomplishments
-use exact time!

Environment:
-less is more
-make it comfortable, not cozy
-seperate from tv, kitchen
-near a window
-phone; put all necessary apps on home screen and delete unecessary apps
-computers; undo automatic logins to sites you like to visit frequently (social media)

Physical & mental:
-daily meditation, positive self-talk
-filter your news
-listen to positive music
-smile more, complain less
-get enough sleep 
-cut yourself slack

"Why coding is only half the answer (the importance of algorithms)"

-How to master your profession:
The difference bt a seasoned programmer and junior: a junior looks for any solution, a senior looks for the best solution.


-logrithms
-anagrams ex: python and typhon (given two strings that have the exact same characters, how would you solve it)
-permutation (a solution for small data but doesn't scale for large data)
